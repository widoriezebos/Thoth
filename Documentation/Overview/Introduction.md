# Introduction to Thoth
Before we delve into the details of what Thoth is all about, lets listen to a conversation between Dave (a Documentation Writer) and an Ian (an IT guy). So Dave comes in on a blue Monday morning after a well deserved and kind of relaxing weekend (I’ll spare you the details). In the coffee corner he finds Ian enjoying an espresso and while pressing the button for his first regular coffee of the day, Dave starts mumbling something about bloody Microsoft Word and revisions. We’re human beings. We all enjoy talking about the moments when tools let us down, especially on Monday mornings. So Ian joins in.

Still using Word for your work then? Well yes, although I am beginning to wonder why. I got a new version of the documentation from Sally and unfortunately she used an older version of the one I had. Merging her changes really made a mess; let alone the fact that for the new version of Product we use a new template now. To make things worse, parts of what she did should also be copied to other documents that mention the concepts. Ian takes a few seconds to respond, pondering whether to put on his consulting hat or start talking about one of his disastrous recovery attempts. No, too painful so the hat it is.

With two releases of product every year I guess that version control in Word simply does not cut it, Ian begins. Dave is about to explain the elaborate folder structure on the shared network drive but then tends to agree there. Nobody ever finds what they need anyways, especially when looking for screenshots of a particular version of the software.
What you need is a good version control system; something we in IT have had for decades Ian continues. With that in place you will never have a problem maintaining different versions of a particular manual and working an a document with Sally won’t be much of a problem either. And placing all of your content in a single document is not a good idea, you should be able to compose documents of smaller parts so that these can be shared across different documents tailored to different audiences.

In reality Dave does not know what to make of this. Seems like an intelligent thing to do but this also sounds like cocky nerd talk to him. And Dave is not a nerd. Dave is frustrated. And frustration is what drives him to continue the conversation.

Ok, so if I get this fancy merging version control system with these nice composition tricks in place what then? Apart from finally getting to grips with content and collaboration, are there more goodies IT can offer? Ian did not expect Dave to catch on this quickly and now get’s the notion of unexpected work coming his way. What Ian meant to achieve was more along the lines of showing off the tricks of his trade, not advertising for more work.

The way forward for Ian in these situations is a proven recipe: just add more to the mix until it all sounds like a very daunting task altogether. And then forget about it. Done.

So on Ian went: Searching and then finding what you need ‘Search Engine style’ of course. And being able to see who did what-when-to-which document etc. etc. And some smart templating rendering mechanism to publish the documents to HTML, PDF, EPUB and whatever you need. The possibilities are endless!

“Wow, sounds like you have experience there” Dave responds. Well, we use VI ourselves says Ian and he continues: that also does the trick. Kind of. By now Ian is hoping that this all sounds rather expensive and indeed to Dave it does. Mission accomplished.

So Dave presses the coffee button again and goes back to his personal Word hell for the week. Such is life.

But not for you, because you are reading this. A system described by Ian is not expensive at all: actually, it is here for free. It is Thoth.
