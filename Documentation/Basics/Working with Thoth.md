# Working with Thoth
Letâ€™s get familiar with the toolset. An important aspect of working with Thoth is version control, currently based on Git. Version control can be a bit daunting if you are new to the concept, but if you stick to the basics and use [a good Git client](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) you will quickly get the hang of it. (Note: For very simple setups you can skip the use of Git altogether and use the File System based content manager)
