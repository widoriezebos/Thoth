## The repository
A Repository is the entire set of documents that are related in some way. For unrelated documents it makes sense to set up more than one repository (for instance different sets of documentation for different products would have one repository per repository)
A Repository is published with Thoth using a corresponding Context (which is just a name for a repository). There are different kinds of repositories that Thoth supports: just a directory on your harddrive, a Git repository or a Zip somewhere on your filesystem.
